# Night Visual

There are various extensions or tools to apply dark mode for any website. This is suitable for the night time, since it helps to reduce the blue light emission from the screen. But suppose we are watching a youtube video in full screen mode and the video contains white background for most of its duration, how is it going to feel? All the dark mode extensions or tools are of no use in this case.

To solve this issue, "Night Visual" helps to apply dark mode to any input image or video buffer. It is a library that takes video or image buffer as input and outputs the dark mode video or image buffer.

There is going to be certain options to use while using this library, such as if colors should be indicated, the dark mode policy etc.
